Got it 👍 — you uploaded a screenshot showing the “Screenshots” section of your **README.md**, but the images (like *MLOps Architecture*, *ECR Screenshot*, *EKS Deployment*, etc.) aren’t displaying properly — they’re showing broken icons instead.

That usually happens because:

1. The image paths in your Markdown are **incorrect or relative** (e.g., `![Alt](mlops_arch.png)`),
2. Or the images are hosted on **GitHub with rate-limited links**, causing that **429: Too Many Requests** error,
3. Or the images are not actually committed/pushed to the repo.

Let’s fix it completely ✅

### 🔧 Here’s the **correct updated code snippet** for your README.md

Replace your current “Screenshots” section with this:

```markdown
## 🖼️ Screenshots

### 📊 MLOps Project Architecture
End-to-end MLOps architecture showing data flow from ingestion to monitoring.  
![MLOps Architecture](assets/mlops_architecture.png)

---

### 🐳 ECR Image Repository
✅ Container image successfully pushed to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).  
![ECR Screenshot](assets/ecr_repository.png)

---

### ☸️ EKS Deployment (kubectl output)
🚀 Flask app deployed on AWS EKS cluster using LoadBalancer service.  
![EKS Deployment](assets/eks_deployment.png)

---

### 📈 Prometheus Metrics
Real-time system monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.  
![Prometheus Metrics](assets/prometheus_metrics.png)
```

---

### 📂 Folder structure

Make sure your repo looks like this:

```
README.md
assets/
 ├── mlops_architecture.png
 ├── ecr_repository.png
 ├── eks_deployment.png
 └── prometheus_metrics.png
```

> ✅ Place all screenshots in the `assets/` folder and commit them.
> 🚫 Do not use GitHub external links (they can trigger “429 Too Many Requests”).

Would you like me to update your README further — for example, add a “📦 Project Overview” or “🚀 Deployment Steps” section above screenshots so it looks more professional for recruiters or GitHub visitors?
